# KompasLib
To connect the library to Kompas3D (cad system app), use the KmpsAppl class and its Connect function.

The library itself will connect to the current document and will switch, if necessary.

The current document can be found in KmpsAppl.Doc (KmpsDoc).

There are a number of ready-made scripts, but they are not a replacement for the original SDK.

Example implementation: https://github.com/urbaraban/KompasCeilingMini.
